## What is a data structure?
    It is a particular way of storing and organising your data.

### Arrays
    Memory Management
    Scoping
    Basic arrays
    Dynamic Arrays - Lists in python
    Problem Solving

#### Memory Management
+ How Data is stored in memory?

    2 major partitions
    + Call Stack
        + Linear
        + Follows LI-FO
            Last In First Out
        + In python - This stores function calls only.
        + Whenever we call a function, a stack from enters the call stack
        + When the call ends i.e. we hit return, stack frame is removed.

        + In python a stack frame only stores references to the variable whereas is C++ they actually sometime store the variable values
        + Real values are stored in heap, only reference is passed in call stack.

    + Heap Area
        Big Pool of memory
        No specific orientation
    
    + Minor partitions
        + Space for global variables
        + Kernel stack

#### Garbage Collection
+ This is an automatic process, which frees unused memory location.

+ CPython
    + It keeps track of all allocated memory.
    + It maintains generation of the memory spot
        + First Gen - newly allocated memory
        + Older Gen - Garabage collector runs on this, to check the unallocated memory and then cleaned.
    + It maintains no. of allocated memory spots & checks if may exceed a threshold, when they exceed, garbage collector is triggered.

+ References counting
    + Counts the number of references, when its number changes, GC triggers.

___
## Arrays
Arrays are linear data structure, which stores homogenous data in contigious memory location.
+ Using array module in python
+ For arrays we need to specify the size as they have fixed length always.
+ Arrays are Mutable.

### Lists
Resizable data structure, containing heterogenous elements stored in continuous memory loss.
Can be resized at runtime.
+ To increase size - It makes a copy with greater size and delete the old array/list.
+ For optimisation - Size is not increased everytime, it gets doubled when it is filled.

TC = theta(1) {average}<br>
Worst case = O(n)

___

## Object Oriented Programming
+ Classes
+ Objects

### Terminologies
___

#### Class
It is a user defined prototype/blueprint for a real world object that defines properties of the object.
All Functions are written here, called as methods.
#### Object
This is an individual real world entity that is based on the blueprint of some class. This is a unique instance of a class.
#### Constructor
Special function which is used to initialise a brand new object from a class.

In python this function is '__init__'
___
___

## Linked Lists
What is need of linked list?

Issues with arrays:
    > We need to give size of arrays
    > Always have contiguous memory allocation.

Linked lists are linear data structure that store one data element in ana entity called as a node, and multiple such nodes are connected to form a chained list. The nodes are not required to be created in continuous memry blocks, so linked lists never consumes continuous memory space.

> Like a necklace, each bead is a node.

+ Each node has:
    + Data value
    + Address value of next node.

Head : First Node
Tail : Last Node

+ Types of linked lists:
    + Singly linked list
    + Doubly linked list
    + Circular linked list

+ Uses:
    + Forward and backward buttons
    + Music players
    + Cache Algorithms
    + Base of Hash-maps

### Linked List Methods
+ Insert at head - O(1) - vs O(n) is arrays
+ Insert at the tail - O(n) - same as arrays
+ Insert at middle - O(n) - same as arrays

### Doubly Linked List
+ Insert at head - O(1) - vs O(n) is arrays
+ Insert at the tail - O(1) 
+ Insert at middle - O(1)

___
___
## Stacks
Works on principle of LIFO
+ Last In First Out

> Analogous to pile of plates, books
+ Used in
    + Call stack
    + Calculations

### Methods in Stack
+ init
+ push
+ pop
+ top
+ size
+ isEmpty
+ clear
